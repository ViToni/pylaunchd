# pylaunchd
MacOS launchd/launchctl GUI

- view macos launch agents and daemons under the `user/system/gui` domains and display detailed properties for each service
- start/stop/enable/disable jobs (WIP) 
- edit service launchers with user configurable editor; some `.plist` files are plain text XML's, for binary `.plist` files consider e.g. [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with [binary plist package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BinaryPlist) installed)

- qt6 - install with `brew install qt6`
- pyqt6 - install with `pip3 install pyqt6`

## Usage 

The program is contained in a single file and can be launched with:
